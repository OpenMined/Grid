# Federated Learning MNIST - PyGrid Example


## About this example

This example contains the implementation of the Federated Learning technique using PyGrid and MNIST dataset.

For this example, we use the Gateway and two Grid Nodes.

If you do not change, MNIST data will be saved in the data folder and trained models will be saved in the models folder.

## How to run

For this example, you simply install the dependencies required to run the Gateway and the Grid Node. By default, the example will assume that there is a gateway running at localhost:5000 and two grid nodes running at localhost:3000 and localhost:3001. You can use more grid nodes as long as you change the code contained in the examples.
