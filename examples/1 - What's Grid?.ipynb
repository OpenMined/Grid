    "Grid platform aim's to be a secure peer to peer platform used to train, manage and share models.We want to use pysyft's features to perform federated learning processes without neeed to manage distributed workers directly.Nowadays, to perform some machine learning process using syft library, the user needs to manage directly all the workers stuff (start nodes, manage node connections, turn off nodes, etc). Our purpose is build a platform that will do this in a transparent way. The user won't need to know about how the nodes are connected or what node have some specific dataset."
