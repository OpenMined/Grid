# Privacy Preserving Deep Learning with PyTorch, PySyft & PyGrid

In this step-by-step tutorial series, you'll learn how PyGrid can be used to bring Privacy and Decentralizacion to a more realistic scenario, i.e., when data lives in a completely isolated environment. This tutorial series is continually updated with new features as they are implemented, and is designed for complete beginners.

These tutorials are organized as follows:
 - **getting-started**. Go here if you have never heard about PyGrid, you'll learn the basics concepts (_comming soon_) .
 - **data-centric**. Go here if you want to use PyGrid plattform from a data-centric perspective. See this [link](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid#model-centric-fl) for more detail (_in progress_).
 - **model-centric**. Go here if you want to use PyGrid plattform from a model-centric perspective. See this [link](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid#data-centric-fl) for more detail (_comming soon_).

## How to Run This Tutorial?
Very easy! Make sure you have [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft#installation) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
If you already have these requirements installed, just clone this repo and run **`docker-compose up`** from root PyGrid folder. Notebooks can be run from deployed jupyter notebbok.

If you want, you can create your own docker-compose using built in images from [docker-hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openmined) for your own purposes.

Next step... Go ahead!

## Why Take This Tutorial?

**1) A Competitive Career Advantage** - For the past 20 years, the digital revolution has made data more and more accessible in ever larger quantities as analog processes have become digitized. However, with new regulation such as [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/), enterprises are under pressure to have less freedom with how they use - and more importantly how they analyze - personal information. **Bottom Line:** Data Scientists aren't going to have access to as much data with "old school" tools, but by learning the tools for privacy preserving Deep Learning, YOU can be ahead of this curve and have a competitive advantage in your career.

**2) Entrepreneurial Opportunities** - There are a whole host of problems in society that Deep Learning can solve, but many of the most important haven't been explored because it would require access to incredibly sensitive information about people (consider using Deep Learning to help people with mental or relationship issues!). Thus, learning Private Deep Learning unlocks a whole host of new startup opportunities for you which were not previously available to others without these toolsets.

**3) Social Good** - Deep Learning can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in the real world, but Deep Learning on *personal information* is Deep Learning about people, *for people*. Learning how to do Deep Learning on data you don't own represents more than a career or entrepreneurial opportunity, it is the opportunity to help solve some of the most personal and important problems in people's lives - and to do it at scale.
