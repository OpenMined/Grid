    "# 2. Serving a Private Model (GPT-2)\n",
    "**protecting model owner's intellectual property (IP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In these series of tutorials you'll learn how to serve and query a private model on Grid. We use the GPT-2 model as an use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning as a Service is already quite relevant in industry, companies train large models on big amounts of data and offer a model's predictions as a service to parties that don't have access to the data or the expertise to train these models. This is beneficial for the company provinding the predictions because they can keep their IP preserved, and is convenient for individuals or organizations that want to have access to the models predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this is a trend in industry, in academia this approach is not as explored. We believe this could be a potential interesting path for research as well, since researchers and organizations can protect their IP but also mitigate malicious use cases or even limit user access to their model while allowing researchers to analyse and interact with the model's outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This potentially can make research easier and faster."
