    "In the previous tutorials we explicitly connected to the workers in order to interact with them, this can be useful for use cases where we want to have control over where the data is stored (which node?) and who performs each role on the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible way to see Grid is that workers that are connected consist of a Grid Network.\n",

    "This network can be seen by a user as a single interface: the Grid Gateway. The Gateway works like a special DNS component but it will route nodes by queries instead of domain names.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to emphasize: the Grid Gateway will not be able to perform any computation process on the nodes. It can not concentrate or centralize any data or model. It works as a brigde between a user that is outside of the grid network to get data / models that live inside the network.\n",
